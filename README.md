## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With Flexbox, arranging elements within containers became a breeze. It made alignment and distribution a snap, adapting seamlessly to different screens. CSS Grid introduced me to two-dimensional layout control, making complex grid creation and responsiveness a cinch. And then there was background positioning â€” a simple yet impactful technique. By combining background images with precise positioning, I learned to create parallax effects, add visual interest, and enhance overall aesthetics.

html {
...
background-image: url("../images/bg-pattern-top-desktop.svg"),
url("../images/bg-pattern-bottom-desktop.svg");
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
background-size: 40%, 70%;
background-position: left top, right bottom -20px;
}

.grid {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
row-gap: 4.8rem;
column-gap: 3.2rem;
align-items: center;
}
